🚀 NexExtractor
NexExtractor is a powerful automation tool built with Puppeteer that helps you uncover businesses on Google Maps—especially those without websites or with a weak online presence.

It works by searching for businesses in specific niches and pulling valuable details like:

🏢 Business Name

🌟 Number of Reviews

📍 Location

🌐 Website (if available)

☎️ Phone Number (if listed)

🎯 Why Use NexExtractor?
Finding potential clients manually is time-consuming. NexExtractor automates the entire process, making it ideal for:

🧑‍💻 Web design agencies looking for clients who need websites

📈 Digital marketers targeting businesses with poor visibility

🤝 B2B outreach and lead generation

🔍 Niche market research and analysis

💡 How It Helps
Instead of clicking through listings one by one, NexExtractor gives you a ready-made list of potential leads—organized and easy to act on. It’s your digital scout for uncovering business opportunities.
